The code imports the following libraries: pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, and folium.

It reads multiple CSV files (uber-raw-data) for different months and merges them into a single DataFrame.

The code performs data preprocessing by converting the 'Date/Time' column to datetime format.

It creates separate DataFrames for morning and evening time periods based on the 'Time' column.

The code generates maps using the folium library, marking coordinates on the maps.

It applies K-means clustering to identify centroids for morning, evening, and overall data.

The code visualizes the centroids on the maps using different marker colors.

It predicts the cluster for a new ride and marks it on the map.

These points highlight skills in data manipulation, data visualization, and machine learning techniques such as K-means clustering.
